        PROJECT HISTORY
    </h2>
        <p class="history">
            “Guess Who” game with JavaFX, involved implementation of client facing features and development of core mechanics, including using API's, and prompt engineering, for automated conversations. There was a strong client focus, developing my talents for eliciting and meeting client needs.
        </p>
        <p class="history">
            Randomised, automatically graded mathematics quiz in Python with Tkinter. This involved working closely with a client (a maths teacher) and stakeholders (students) to iteratively develop the program, to meet stakeholder requirements. Followed the waterfall methodology, including setting and keeping clear schedules for each stage of the process.
        </p>
        <p class="history">
            Venue Hire system, involving making bookings, managing venues, calculating costs, and more in both Java (through the terminal) and Python using Tkinter to make an interface. This project was primarily targeted at developing my OOP skills, introducing design patterns and some data structures.
        </p>
        <p class="history">
            Several encryption and decryption algorithms, using MATLAB, as a means of implementing complex mathematical concepts, in simple and efficient code.
        </p>    
        <p class="history">
            Implementations of several sorting algorithms, as a means of calculating algorithm efficiency, and developing my skills in Python.
        </p>    
        <p class="history">
            Image processing in MATLAB, including resizing and recolouring, as well as hashing and fingerprinting for image similarity comparisons.
        </p>    
        <p class="history">
            Battleships game in C, allowing for multiplayer, or single player play against bots of various difficulties. 
        </p>    
        <p class="history">
            Many other projects including the snake game, in QB64; a pizza ordering interface and invoice printer, both using Python and Tkinter; a RISK board game map traversal algorithm in Java; several data analyses in R-Studio; editing game mods in Java; and getting game development experience with Godot Game Engine and GDScript.
